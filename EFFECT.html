<h1>EFFECTS OF WATER POLLUTION</h1><BR>
<p>Water pollution can bring about disastrous consequences – for instance, a factory that pumped out a very toxic waste product into the sea directly contributed to causing neurological illness to an entire town for many decades (The Minimata Incident). The following are the effects of water pollution:

Water pollution drastically affects human health; in fact, it can kill. In 2015 alone, a study revealed that waterborne illnesses caused 1.8 million deaths worldwide.
It can cause contamination of drinking water – thereby contributing to waterborne illnesses.
Water pollution also affects the ecosystem – it can cause a phenomenon called eutrophication. This can cause fish and other aquatic organisms to die.
Toxic elements dissolved in water can make their way to humans through fish or other aquatic organisms.
Water pollution also leaches chemicals into the soil that may impact the growth of plants or other food crops.<br><br>
